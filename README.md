# Hello

I'm Dustin. I'm a developer, designer, and artist. I have a huge passion for frontend development and minimal tooling. I love to write apps that are small, fast, and accessible.

I'm currently working full-time as a frontend engineer and part-time on a few other projects. When I'm not working I'm usually painting or doodling on my iPad.
