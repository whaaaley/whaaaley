# Hello

I'm Dustin. I'm a self taught developer, designer, and artist. I have a huge passion for micro frameworks and minimal tooling. I love to write apps that are small, fast, and accessible to anyone.

I'm currently working full-time as a frontend engineer and part-time on a few other projects. In my freetime I'm currently working on my frontend project Pocket and writing plugins for esbuild.
